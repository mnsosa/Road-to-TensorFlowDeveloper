# TensorFlowCourse
This is my repository to learn TensorFlow from coursera.org

The course I will be following is the next one: https://www.coursera.org/learn/introduction-tensorflow/home/welcome

This is the first course of the especialization by DeepLearning.AI called "TensorFlow Developer Professional Certificate".
